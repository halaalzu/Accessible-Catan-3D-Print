# Accessible-Catan-3D-Print
A physical redesign of Settlers of Catan that improves usability for players with hand tremors by making tiles magnetic, larger, and using slot-based placement. The design preserves original gameplay and social experience.

# Accessible Catan Board Redesign

This project explores a physical redesign of the board game *Settlers of Catan* to improve accessibility for players with hand tremors caused by conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis.

The goal of the redesign is to **increase stability, reduce accidental piece movement, and improve grip and placement**, while preserving the original rules, pacing, and social experience of the game.

This repository contains design files, documentation, and prototype visuals developed as part of a systems design engineering project at the University of Waterloo.

## Project Overview

Traditional Catan gameplay relies on small, lightweight pieces placed on a modular board that can easily shift when bumped. For players with tremors, this can lead to frequent disruptions, loss of independence, and frustration during gameplay.

This redesign addresses those challenges by:
- Securing tiles together using magnets
- Adding indents and slots for roads, settlements, cities, and number tokens
- Increasing the size, weight, and chamfering of pieces for improved grip
- Redesigning ports as triangular edge tiles to reduce overall board size

The result is a board that resists accidental movement while remaining intuitive and familiar to experienced Catan players.

## Key Design Features

- **Magnetically Connected Tiles**  
  Tiles connect via embedded magnets, eliminating the need for the original ocean frame and improving board stability.

- **Slot-Based Piece Placement**  
  Roads, settlements, cities, and number tokens fit into dedicated indents, increasing resistance to lateral movement while remaining easy to insert and remove.

- **Ergonomic Game Pieces**  
  Pieces are larger, slightly heavier, and feature chamfered edges to improve graspability for users with limited fine motor control.

- **Reachable Board Layout**  
  Reimagined ports and removal of the ocean frame reduce overall board footprint while maintaining full gameplay functionality.

## Intended Users

This design primarily supports players with:
- Mild to moderate hand tremors (e.g., up to Stage 3 Parkinson’s disease)
- Reduced fine motor control
- A desire to play physical board games independently without disrupting gameplay

The redesign also benefits non-disabled players by creating a more stable, frustration-free playing experience.
